# Penguin
Penguin, send Everybody Edits commands in plain English

Big thank you to UGotPwned who created Penguin--I'm just the one who is hosting it.

With Penguin, you can send commands to EE in plain English. This means that I can say "fill this with grey blocks" and Penguin will fill any closed shape with those blocks.

You can get more complicated and say "hey could you change all of the orange blocks and the red ones with green ones?" If ambiguities occur, Penguin will ask you questions to help narrow down which blocks you meant.

Penguin is not limited to just changing blocks. Try it out for yourself!
